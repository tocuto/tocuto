## Hello!
My name is Iv√°n, but I go by `tocu` online.
I am a backend engineer with a mechanical technician background who loves tinkering with networks and game development. I have a can-do attitude and will try to solve almost any problem thrown at me.

You can learn more about my work and who I am at my [portfolio](https://tocuto.github.io/)!
